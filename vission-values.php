                <h3>The Essence of Moulis</h3>
                <p>
                    Moulis (plural for Mouli) means Lord Shiva. Is Shiva a form? Is Shiva somebody sitting in some place? No. Shiva is the entire Universe. Shiva is the essence from which everything is created, everything is sustained and into which everything is dissolved. Shiva is the entire creation (Vishwaroopa) and yet he is formless or Nirakaar. Similarly, our advertising agency is a creative representation of Shiva, where our world of communication solutions comes to life; they are sustained and later relinquished to give birth to the new. Our five values are but a derivative of the threefold power of Shiva â€“ symbolised by the Tripundra or Trident, namely, Ichha Shakti (Willpower), Jnana Shakti (Knowledge power) and Kriya Shakti (Power of Action).
